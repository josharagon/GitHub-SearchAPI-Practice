#### 2. If anything matches your search query you will be given cards with details about those related repositories. ![search results](https://i.gyazo.com/3f098bcfd5a236439dc30e03b005b116.gif)

#### 3. If no results are found you will be given an option to return to the search bar and try again. ![no results](https://gyazo.com/6bd59e78d85154226a455a8efd8979ae.gif)

#### 4. In the case you do get results, you have the options to filter by best match(default), star count, or fork count. You can also filter by language to just receive 1 specific language results. ![filter results](https://gyazo.com/bbf007b7c270ac15fa0504dad137fde1.gif)
